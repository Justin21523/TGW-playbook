 **TGW Playbook** is a hands-on repository to master **oobabooga/text-generation-webui** on Windows/WSL.
 It wires TGW to a **single shared model/cache warehouse** (`ai_warehouse`) to avoid duplicate downloads, and provides:

 * Stage-by-Stage guides (chat/instruct/roleplay, parameters, RAG, agents, OpenAI-compatible API, multimodal)
 * Ready-to-use **presets**, **character cards**, **instruction/chat templates**
 * **Scripts** to start TGW with `--model-dir`, validate env, batch-download models, and test API
 * Minimal **LoRA** training examples and evaluation tips
 * Docker & AMD/ROCm notes, troubleshooting, and Conventional-Commits Git flow
   Keep upstream TGW pristine; version your own configs and learning assets here.
